# CNN Model Training

This directory contains the files related to training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for the project "Advanced Material Classification Using Sensor Fusion & Machine Learning".

## Files

- **CNNModelTraining.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for training the CNN model.
- **cnnmodeltraining.py**: Python script for training the CNN model.

## Overview

The CNN model is trained to classify materials such as metals, plastics, and glass based on sensor data. The model is developed and trained using the Jupyter Notebook and Python script provided in this directory.

## Usage

### Training the Model Using Jupyter Notebook

1. Navigate to the `CNNModelTraining` directory:
   ```bash
   cd CNNModelTraining
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `CNNModelTraining.ipynb` using Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook CNNModelTraining.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the CNN model.

### Training the Model Using Python Script

1. Navigate to the `CNNModelTraining` directory:
   ```bash
   cd CNNModelTraining
   ```
2. Run the Python script to train the CNN model:
   ```bash
   python cnnmodeltraining.py
   ```
