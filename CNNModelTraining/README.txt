# Instructions to Run CNN Model Training Files

Overview:
This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to run the provided machine learning model files for the project. The files include:
- CNNModelTraining.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file containing the code for training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
- cnnmodeltraining.py: Python script file containing the same code for training the model.

Requirements:
Ensure that you have the following software installed on your system:
1. Python 3.x: You can download Python from python.org.
2. Jupyter Notebook: Install Jupyter Notebook by running the command:
   ```
   pip install notebook
   ```
3. Necessary Python Libraries: Install the required libraries using the following command:
   ```
   pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```

Running the Jupyter Notebook File:
1. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the CNNModelTraining.ipynb file.
   - Start Jupyter Notebook by running the command:
     ```
     jupyter notebook
     ```
2. Run the Notebook:
   - In the Jupyter interface, navigate to the file CNNModelTraining.ipynb and open it.
   - Run the cells sequentially by selecting a cell and clicking the 'Run' button or pressing Shift + Enter.

Running the Python Script File:
1. Open Terminal/Command Prompt:
   - Navigate to the directory containing the cnnmodeltraining.py file.
2. Execute the Script:
   - Run the script using Python by executing the following command:
     ```
     python cnnmodeltraining.py
     ```

Notes:
- Ensure that the dataset paths specified in the code are correct and accessible from your working directory.
- The models will be trained using the provided dataset and the results will be displayed at the end of the execution.
