# Instructions to Run the Flap Control System INO File

Overview:
This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to run the provided Arduino sketch file named FlapControlSystem.ino for controlling the flap mechanism in the project.

Requirements:
Ensure that you have the following software and hardware setup:
1. Arduino IDE: Download and install the Arduino IDE from the Arduino official website.
2. Arduino Board: Ensure you have the appropriate Arduino board connected to your computer.
3. Required Libraries: Ensure the necessary libraries are installed in the Arduino IDE.

Running the INO File:
1. Open Arduino IDE:
   - Launch the Arduino IDE on your computer.
2. Open the Sketch File:
   - In the Arduino IDE, navigate to File > Open.
   - Select the FlapControlSystem.ino file and open it.
3. Select the Correct Board and Port:
   - In the Arduino IDE, go to Tools > Board and select the appropriate Arduino board model.
   - Go to Tools > Port and select the port to which your Arduino board is connected.
4. Upload the Sketch:
   - Click the Upload button (right arrow icon) in the Arduino IDE to compile and upload the sketch to the Arduino board.
   - Ensure there are no compilation errors and the upload is successful.

Notes:
- Ensure all the necessary sensors and actuators are connected to the correct pins on the Arduino board as specified in the code.
- Verify the connections and pin assignments before running the system.
- Monitor the Serial Monitor (Tools > Serial Monitor) for any debug messages or output from the Arduino board.
