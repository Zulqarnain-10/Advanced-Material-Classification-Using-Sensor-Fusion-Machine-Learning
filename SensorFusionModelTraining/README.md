# Sensor Fusion Model Training

This directory contains the files related to training the sensor fusion model for the project "Advanced Material Classification Using Sensor Fusion & Machine Learning".

## Files

- **SensorFusionModelTraining.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for training the sensor fusion model.
- **sensorfusionmodeltraining.py**: Python script for training the sensor fusion model.

## Overview

The sensor fusion model is designed to classify materials such as metals, plastics, and glass based on data from multiple sensors. The model is developed and trained using the Jupyter Notebook and Python script provided in this directory.

## Usage

### Training the Model Using Jupyter Notebook

1. Navigate to the `SensorFusionModelTraining` directory:
   ```bash
   cd SensorFusionModelTraining
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `SensorFusionModelTraining.ipynb` using Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook SensorFusionModelTraining.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the sensor fusion model.

### Training the Model Using Python Script

1. Navigate to the `SensorFusionModelTraining` directory:
   ```bash
   cd SensorFusionModelTraining
   ```
2. Run the Python script to train the sensor fusion model:
   ```bash
   python sensorfusionmodeltraining.py
   ```
